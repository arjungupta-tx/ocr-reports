            I have three OCR outputs from the same document. Each OCR result may have missing sentences, incorrect text, or variations in formatting. 
            I want you to analyze the three versions and create one perfect document by combining all the accurate and missing content.


            Here are the documents:

                1. Document 1:

            Your task is to:
                - Identify missing sentences or text in any of the documents.
                - Resolve inconsistencies or differences.
                - Combine all the content into one coherent, accurate document.
